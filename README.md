Microsoft Teams Clone is a simple one-to-one video call app  built in python using Agora SDK. 
Two people can connect in a channel using the App-id from agora.io. Live chat is incorporated using PubNub. An additional screen recording feature is also availabe.

Python is very convenient to work with. It is High level, Interpreted, Object-oriented, Interactive, Modular, Dynamic, Portable and Extensible in C++ & C.
It's advantages are that it is easy to read and write, low maintainance cost, no harms for the software bugs  and it also allows integration with other languages.
It's slow execution speed and large memory consumption makes it weak in mobile computing. But, as my task is to create an application that works on the desktop, python is a good option.
